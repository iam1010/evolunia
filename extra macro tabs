To create an extra tab in your macros just add:
  local extras = addTab("Extras")
To your config.

You'll also have to specify what tab to put macros in. For example I use a tab called "Extras" for stuff I don't use or stuff I want to enable once and then forget about.

Example:
macro(10000, "Auto Eat", function()
  use(3725)
end, extras) -- here you specify the variable name of tab to put macro in.
